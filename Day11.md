# 🚀 Blog 10: Advanced Graph Tricks & Real-World Applications

Graphs form the backbone of **network design, routing, compilers, scheduling, recommendation systems, DNA sequencing, and even blockchain**. Beyond BFS/DFS, shortest paths, and MST, there are deeper tricks and problems every engineer should know.

This blog brings together **advanced graph concepts**, interview classics, and real-world applications.

## 🧭 1. Eulerian Path & Circuit

* **Eulerian Path:** Visits every edge exactly once.
* **Eulerian Circuit:** A path that starts and ends at the same vertex, visiting every edge once.

**Condition:**

* Eulerian Path exists if **0 or 2 vertices have odd degree**.
* Eulerian Circuit exists if **all vertices have even degree**.

🔹 **Application:**

* Route planning (postman problem).
* DNA sequencing (finding Eulerian paths in De Bruijn graphs).

**Java Snippet:**

```java
public boolean hasEulerianCircuit(int V, List<List<Integer>> adj) {
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (adj.get(i).size() % 2 != 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## 🧩 2. Hamiltonian Path & Cycle

* **Hamiltonian Path:** Visits every vertex exactly once.
* **Hamiltonian Cycle:** Path that starts and ends at the same vertex, visiting all vertices once.

**Difference vs. Eulerian:**

* Eulerian → covers **edges**.
* Hamiltonian → covers **vertices**.

🔹 **Application:**

* Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
* Bioinformatics (DNA assembly).

**Backtracking Template:**

```java
boolean hamiltonianPath(int[][] graph, int pos, boolean[] visited, int count) {
    if (count == graph.length) return true;

    for (int v = 0; v < graph.length; v++) {
        if (graph[pos][v] == 1 && !visited[v]) {
            visited[v] = true;
            if (hamiltonianPath(graph, v, visited, count + 1)) return true;
            visited[v] = false;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## 🧮 3. Graph Compression (Heavy-Light Decomposition, Centroid Decomposition)

* **Heavy-Light Decomposition (HLD):** Breaks trees into heavy paths + light edges → useful for **LCA queries, range queries on paths**.
* **Centroid Decomposition:** Recursive decomposition of tree → useful in **divide-and-conquer algorithms on trees**.

🔹 **Applications:**

* Dynamic programming on trees.
* Network routing optimization.

## ⚡ 4. Graph Coloring

* Assign colors to vertices so no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
* NP-Complete for general graphs, but greedy approximations work.

🔹 **Applications:**

* Register allocation in compilers.
* Timetable scheduling.
* Map coloring.

**Greedy Example:**

```java
public int[] graphColoring(int V, List<List<Integer>> adj) {
    int[] result = new int[V];
    Arrays.fill(result, -1);
    result[0] = 0;

    boolean[] available = new boolean[V];
    for (int u = 1; u < V; u++) {
        Arrays.fill(available, true);

        for (int v : adj.get(u)) {
            if (result[v] != -1) available[result[v]] = false;
        }

        int color;
        for (color = 0; color < V; color++) if (available[color]) break;
        result[u] = color;
    }
    return result;
}
```

1. **Web & Social Networks**

   * PageRank (Google search) = graph centrality.
   * Friend recommendation = shortest path / bipartite matching.

2. **Networking & Routing**

3. **Scheduling & Dependency Management**

   * Topological sort in build systems (Maven/Gradle).
   * Task scheduling in cloud platforms.

4. **Transport & Logistics**

   * Eulerian paths for garbage collection/postal delivery.
   * Hamiltonian cycles for TSP in supply chain.

5. **Biology & Chemistry**

   * Protein interaction networks.
   * DNA sequencing with Eulerian paths.

6. **Cybersecurity & Blockchain**

   * Strongly connected components for vulnerability detection.
   * Graph compression for transaction flow analysis.
